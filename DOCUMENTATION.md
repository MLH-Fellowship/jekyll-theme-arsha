# Development Guide

This section is useful for developers who are interested in customizing the theme.

## Getting Started

### Build

To install all the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` and `.gemspec` files (runtime_dependency,
development_dependency, dependency), run the following command:

```shell
bundle install
```

### Run

To preview your theme, run the Jekyll server:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config.development.yml --livereload
# then run clean to remove the generated files
bundle exec jekyll clean
# you can also build
bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.development.yml
```

Check [Serve Command Options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#serve-command-options) for more
arguments.

## Notes

- Designed to be hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
- Designed to be used with [`jekyll-remote-theme`](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme).
- Make sure to keep the `github-pages` gem updated.
- All the dependencies used by the theme should be supported by GitHub
  Pages (check [dependency versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/)).
- During gem development, the `Gemfile` is just used for development environment setup.
- In our case, the `.gemspec` file is optional. If you don't have it, you can still use the theme with
  `jekyll-remote-theme`, but we can't publish it to Rubygems. We just using it for development environment setup.
- This package isn't intended to be published to Rubygems.
- If you need to develop against a gem that hasn't yet been released, you can specify it in `Gemfile`.

### Naming Convention

Jekyll use `liquid` as templating engine, we recommend using the following naming convention to get a better developer
experience while using Jetbrains IDEs (they support `liquid` syntax):

- `*.liquid` files (processed as HTML files with Liquid code) or `*.html.liquid`.
- `*.md.liquid` for Markdown files
- `*.css.liquid` for CSS files

> But the problem is that the `.liquid` extension is not omitted by Jekyll during the build process. We suggest you to
> configure your IDE by going to  `File > Settings > Editor > File Types > Liquid template` and adding `*.html`.

### `assets/` folder

- The folder will be copied to the `assets` folder of the theme.
- Some files may contain `liquid` tags, for dynamic content.
- We should include the following `Front Matter` header in the top of files that is using `liquid` templating language:
  ```
  ---
  # The empty front matter at the top tells Jekyll it needs to process the file.
  ---
  ```
  This will tell Jekyll to process the file as a `liquid` file.

### File Encoding

> All markdown and html files should be using `UTF-8` to be processed by Jekyll.

You can convert a file to `UTF-8` by using the following command (on macOS):

```shell
F_NAME='Primer-00.md'; iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 $F_NAME > $F_NAME.utf8; rm $F_NAME; mv $F_NAME.utf8 $F_NAME
```

### Permalinks behavior

```shell
permalink: welcome-to-jekyll/ or /welcome-to-jekyll/ # => will generate _site/welcome-to-jekyll/index.html
permalink: /welcome-to-jekyll or welcome-to-jekyll or /welcome-to-jekyll.html or welcome-to-jekyll.html # => will generate _site/welcome-to-jekyll.html
```

# Development Guide

## Getting Started

### Build

To install all the dependencies listed in the `Gemfile` and `.gemspec` files (runtime_dependency,
development_dependency, dependency), run the following command:

```shell
bundle install
```

### Run

To preview your theme, run the Jekyll server:

# then run clean to remove the generated files
bundle exec jekyll clean
# you can also build
bundle exec jekyll build --config _config.yml,_config.development.yml
```

Check [Serve Command Options](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/#serve-command-options) for more
arguments.

### Dependencies

All the dependencies that are being used by the theme are bundled
within [the GitHub Pages Ruby gem](https://pages.github.com/versions/).

When you are using the theme through jekyll-remote-theme, you need to add the following to your `Gemfile` in order to
run your site locally:

```ruby
gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins # emulates github-pages environment locally
gem "bundler", group: :jekyll_plugins # Gems manager (optional)
gem "rake", group: :jekyll_plugins # build utility (optional)
gem "webrick", '~> 1.7', group: :jekyll_plugins # HTTP server toolkit, fix for ruby >= 3.0
```

> When you publish your site to GitHub Pages, it will not install gems from your `Gemfile` and you will only
> have the gem `github-pages` installed.

----- TODO: Delete this -----  
Welcome to your new Jekyll theme! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your theme
into a gem.

Put your layouts in `_layouts`, your includes in `_includes`, your sass files in `_sass` and any other assets
in `assets`.

To experiment with this code, add some sample content and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` â€“ this directory is setup just
like a Jekyll site!

## Development

To set up your environment to develop this theme, run `bundle install`.

Your theme is setup just like a normal Jekyll site! To test your theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your
browser at `http://localhost:4000`. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like
normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will
regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.

When your theme is released, only the files in `_layouts`, `_includes`, `_sass` and `assets` tracked with Git will be
bundled.
To add a custom directory to your theme-gem, please edit the regexp in `jekyll-theme-arsha.gemspec` accordingly.
