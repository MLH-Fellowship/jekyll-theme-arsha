through [jekyll-remote-theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme)

```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml

And then install the theme's Gem using: ```bundle``` or ```gem install jekyll-theme-arsha```

## Usage

This section describes how you can use this theme to build a site for your business with a portfolio.

### Available Layouts

The theme includes the following layouts:

- `default`: contains default CSS, JS, FavIcon, Header and Footer.
- `home`:  same as default.
- `page`: same as default + breadcrumbs + Disqus(if configured). You can use it to add more pages (
  example: [About Page](./about.md) )
- `post`: same as page. You can use it to add projects to your company portfolio. (Examples: [Posts](./_posts))

### custom Landing Page

Create an `index.html` inside your project and copy code from [the default index](./index.html), then customize it.

### custom Header, Footer and other includes

To override any include, create the corresponding file in your project, copy code from the theme, then customize it.

For example if we want to customize the header, we create an `_includes/header.html` file, we copy default code
from [the default header](./_includes/header.html), then we edit it.

### Logo

We can use an image logo by adding this line to `_config.yml`:

```yaml
logo: assets/img/logo.png # path relative to the project
```

> By default, we use the value of `name` from `_config.yml` as logo.
